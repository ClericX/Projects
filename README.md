This repository is here to present examples of my programming done within the last few years. Note that the work displayed here is only a fraction of all the programming done throughout my time doing so.

The files displayed for each project are only the source files, nothing additional which may be part of the total project file hierarchy (project configuration files, images/resource files, etc) has been included, to keep things clean and focus on display of code. While this means some projects can't be compiled or otherwise used completely as they are given, it most certainly would be possible for someone who knows what they are doing to compile or otherwise use code demonstrated with a little effort.

All code displayed is released as open source, and may be copied, modified, used, and redistributed in any way with no restrictions. Giving credit where it is due is appreciated but not required.

While source code for entire projects is fully inclusive, some code may not represent fully completed or necessarily up-to-date versions of projects which are incomplete and possibly still under development. Such projects may be periodically updated with more recent revisions of source code, and further projects may also be periodically added.
