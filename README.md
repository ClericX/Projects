Welcome!

This repository is here to showcase various pieces of my work, older and newer, that I have programmed throughout my many years of being a programmer. It is important to note that all work displayed here is only a fraction of all the programming I have done throughout my time doing so. All source code posted does not include any project configuration files which may have been used in it's development, and there is no guarantee that all resources (such as images) which may be necessary for intended execution of a project or code snippet are included. The source code shown is not intended for a download/compile/execute process by a viewer, it is shown primarily for demonstration of my knowledge and ability in programming. However, it most certainly would be possible for someone who knows what they are doing to compile or otherwise use code demonstrated. All code displayed is released as open source, and may be copied, modified, used, and redistributed in any way with no restrictions. Giving credit where it is due would be nice, but is not required. While source code for entire projects is fully inclusive, some code may not represent fully completed or necessarily up-to-date versions of projects which are incomplete and possibly still under development. Such projects may be periodically updated with more recent revisions of source code, and further projects may also be periodically added.
